        <h4>The Ice City</h4>
        <p>Harbin is a city in north-east China, the capital of the Heilongjiang province. Known for famous Ice and Snow Festival and its historic architecture, this frigid city in the northern-most prefecture is a sight to behold.</p>
        <p>The city is the eighth most populous in China, with 5.8 million residents in the city proper, and 10 million in the wider metro area. It is home to several major universities and is particularly notable for its technology and scientific universities.</p>
        <p>Harbin also has a rich architectural history. In the early 20th century Harbin was a small town which grew quickly as Russia built the city as a showcase of Russian imperialism. Harbin has historically been ethnically diverse, which brought different architectural styles over time.</p>
