        <h4>The Developer</h4>
        <p>Hello! My name is Tegan Jetton. I'm an aspiring developer in Chicago, IL, interested both in Web Development as well as OOP. I'm currently studying both Web Dev and Java. I was born in Mid-Michigan, where I went to art school to study Sculpture and minored in Chinese Language and Culture.</p>
        <p>I chose Harbin since it's the city my step-mom is from. Ever since learning about it I've wanted to visit and see the Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival. My step-mom's family all lives in Beijing now, which I'd also love to visit. I'm hoping to plan a vacation there in the next couple years.</p>
